Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.i)reliability-its ensures software  performs as expected without bias
ii)efficiency-helps optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards 
iii)security-impliment protection practice like authorisation to secure users information 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.i)mastering complexity
ii)mastering process
iii)mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i)planning-Identify the software requirement or purpose and scop.
ii)requirement analysis-Identify the final user specification.
iii)Design-build the framework  
iv)Coding-converting software design into tagible code.
v)Testing-examine the software for any bugs and glitches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i)waterfall methodology  is linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on,there is low flexibility and changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.customer feedback comes late,after the product is developed and testing is done at the end of the development process.
ii)Agile methodology is iterative and incremental,with multiple cycles,high flexibility thus adapts to changing requirements and regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint,also the testing is continuous and done after every iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i)software developer-developing application,programs and system using programming languages and frameworks.
ii)Quality Assurance Engineer-collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
iii)Project Manager-assembles and read the software development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i)IDEs  contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
ii)An IDE can make suggestions to complete  a code statement when the developer begins typing.
iii)IDE increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change.
i)VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflict.
ii)change tracking-records detailed history of changes,allowing easy analysis of each modification .
iii)Branching and merging-supports creating branches for new features and merging them vack inti yhe main code.
Error recovery-allowa reverting to previous  versions if new changes introduce errors 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i)rapid technological advancement-
adopting continuous  learning practices and using agile methodologies.
ii)Time constraint-adopting agile methodologies.
iii)Limited infrastructure-software engineers must rely heavily on arobust infrastructure.
iv)Changing software requirements-adopt approaches like agile development.
v)Software security -research ways to defend against hacking,malware.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i)unity test-they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes,components or modules.
ii)Intergration test-they verify  that different  modules or services used by the application work well together.
iii)system testing-they focus on the entire software as awhole including all functionalities and interactions.
iv)Acceptance test-they are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
i)Improve user experience-it helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human  bias in the large language  models  training data.
ii)increased flexibility-a prompt engineer can create prompts with domain neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
iii)Developer control-effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the larger  language  models  


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
i)clarity-the improved  prompt  specificies what is being  asked rather than a "picture"
ii)specific details-describing  the appearance  and the setting giving  clear  guidance on the image to be created.
iii)concise-the additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the user to understand what  exactly is needed.
